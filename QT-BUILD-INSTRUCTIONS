QtMediaHub requires:

:Some Qt knowledge:

Please read:

http://doc.trolltech.com/4.7-snapshot/gettingstarted-develop.html#deployment

to get familiar with Qt specific build considerations.

If you are new to Linux development, I urge you to try to run Gentoo Linux:

http://www.gentoo.org/

which will embolden you to Linux development and which has some killer
documentation.

:Qt:

Qt requires a host of dependencies, you can either repeatedly rerun
configure installing deps as you go until Qt has detected all the
functionality you require, or you can run:

Ubuntu:

apt-get build-dep qt4-x11

Meego:

zypper source-install qt

You will need pkg-config and git (git-core package on demented distros) to follow
these instructions.

We maintain a known functional Qt 4.7 branch qmh-qt-4.7-baseline which
resides at:

https://qt.gitorious.org/+mediatrolls/qt/dcarrs-qt

This branch tracks Qt 4.7 with additional:

1) Bug workarounds
2) Backported patches from Qt 4.8

it should be very close to Qt 4.7 head. It is tested and known to work
against Qt Media Hub. (You should always be able to track it)

1) git clone git@gitorious.org:+mediatrolls/qt/dcarrs-qt.git qmh-qt
2) cd qmh-qt
3) git checkout qmh-qt-4.7-baseline
4) ./configure -foo .......
5) make (&& make install)

:Qt Mobility:

We have a hard requirement of Qt Multimedia which exists as part of the Qt
Mobility project.

1) git clone git@gitorious.org:qt-mobility/qt-mobility.git
2) cd qt-mobility
3) ./configure -prefix $sameAsQtPrefix -modules "multimedia" -foo ........
4) make (&& make install)

Note: Take care, that the /bin directory (for qmake) of your Qt installation is part of your search path.

Certain plugins also make use of the "location" and "systeminfo" modules,
but these are optional dependencies
